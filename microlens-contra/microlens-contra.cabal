name:                microlens-contra
version:             0.1.0.3
synopsis:            True folds and getters for microlens
description:
  This package provides @Fold@ and @Getter@ that are fully compatible with lens; the downside is that this package depends on contravariant, which in its turn depends on a lot of other packages (but still less than lens).
  .
  The difference between @Fold@ and @SimpleFold@ is that you can use e.g. @takingWhile@\/@droppingWhile@ and @backwards@ on the former but not on the latter. Most functions from lens that work with @Fold@ would work with @SimpleFold@ as well, though.
  .
  Starting from GHC 8.6, this package doesn't depend on contravariant anymore.
  .
  This package is a part of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens microlens> family; see the readme <https://github.com/stevenfontanella/microlens#readme on Github>.
